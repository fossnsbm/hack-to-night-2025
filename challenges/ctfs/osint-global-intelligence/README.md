# Global Intelligence Network

## Challenge Setup

This complex challenge involves multiple data sources that participants must correlate to uncover a simulated cyber attack plan:

1. Create a fictional threat intelligence report with:
   - Mention of threat actor group "BlackVoltage"
   - Partial IOCs (IP addresses, domains, hashes)
   - Timeline of previous attacks
   - References to encrypted chat platforms

2. Create cryptocurrency transaction records showing:
   - Payments between key threat actors
   - Dates correlating with attack preparation
   - Wallet addresses to trace

3. Create fictional social media presence:
   - Telegram group screenshots with partial conversations
   - Twitter/X accounts with coded messages
   - Dark web forum posts discussing the attack

4. Create technical artifacts:
   - Malware samples (benign files with metadata only)
   - Network traffic logs showing reconnaissance
   - Email samples showing phishing campaign preparation
   - Infrastructure details (C2 servers, staging areas)

5. Create geographic data:
   - Maps showing targeted power grid facilities
   - Locations of threat actors
   - Timeline of activity across different time zones

## Solution Guide

This challenge requires advanced correlation across multiple data sources:

1. Initial Threat Actor Identification:
   - Analyze threat intelligence reports about "BlackVoltage"
   - Identify key members through social media analysis
   - Track cryptocurrency transactions between members

2. Attack Timeline Analysis:
   - Correlate dates from various sources
   - Identify June 15th as the planned attack date
   - Map preparation activities leading up to the attack

3. Target Identification:
   - Analyze reconnaissance data showing power grid interest
   - Map IP addresses to critical infrastructure
   - Identify specific power grid components being targeted

4. Attack Method Discovery:
   - Analyze phishing email templates in preparation
   - Find ransomware code snippets in dark web posts
   - Identify the delivery mechanism (phishing campaign)

5. Compile all information to form the flag:

## Deployment Notes

- Create a complex web interface simulating an intelligence platform
- Provide downloadable files for offline analysis
- Include interactive elements that reveal new information based on findings
- Create realistic but fictional threat actor profiles
- Ensure all artifacts are clearly marked as fictional/CTF content
