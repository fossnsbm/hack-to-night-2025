                    <p>For gods are prone to wrath and pain.</p>
                    <p>One day upon the Aegean shore,</p>
                    <p>A mortal king would beg for more.</p>

                    <p>A god in wild and shifting forms.</p>
                    <p>His beard was kelp, his gaze a flame,</p>
                    <p>His voice, the thunder none could tame.</p>
                    <p>"To beg the sea, to dare demand,</p>
                    <p>Is to invite a god's own hand!"</p>
                    <p>He struck his trident on the sand—</p>
                    <p>And lo, the tides devoured the land.</p>

                    <p>Ships were shattered, towers drowned,</p>
                    <p>And oaths were lost without a sound.</p>
                    <p>But one lone girl, with eyes so wide,</p>
                    <p>Stood defiant gainst the tide.</p>
                    <p>She cried, “If gods are just and wise,</p>
                    <p>Why answer prayers with drowned replies?”</p>
                    <p>Poseidon paused, his brow grew stern,</p>
                    <p>
                        As memory began to churn.

                    <p>A mortal maiden, voice aglow.</p>
                    <p>Amphitrite, of grace so fair,</p>

                    <p>Till she, at last, in stillness wept—</p>
                    <p>And in her sorrow, the ocean slept.</p>

                    <p>But quelled at last his own desire.</p>
                    <p>She ruled beside him, proud and wise,</p>
                    <p>The queen of waves and ocean skies.</p>
                    <p>But mortals knew not love like this,</p>
                    <p>Their hearts were frail, their minds amiss.</p>
                    <p>He&apos;d offered gifts of horse and rain,</p>
                    <p>
                        Yet met with shrines unkept, disdain.

                    <p>Yet not with fire, and not with blade,</p>

                    <p>A temple rose upon the coast—</p>
